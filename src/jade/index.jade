				h3 problem
				p People waste years of their life doing jobs they hate; they feel like their degree is useless, but it's just too late to change majors. People feel pigeon-holed with their degree.
				p 80% of students enter college undeclared, and the lack of guidance certainly doesn't help.

			section(class="section" id="solution")
				h3 solution
				p Our solution at Braintrust is to inspire people with their calling.
				p We are building a predictive tool that provides individuals with career opportunities and innovations that are relevant to their skills, education, experience, and interests. Using information that students already know about themselves, we are helping students take their passion and make it their career.

			section(class="section" id="about")
				h3 about
				p Braintrust is made up of 7 individuals seeking to change the way the world approaches education, specifically change the way students choose or change their majors. Our team consists of creative strategists, educators, a web developer, and a lot of desire to help students find their passion.
